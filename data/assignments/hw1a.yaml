  In this assignment you will write HTML and CSS. We 
  do not expect you to be able to write a website from
  scratch afterward. Instead, you should be able to 
  look at the a piece of HTML or CSS and understand
  roughly what it does.

### Background

Every website you look at with your browser is written in [Hypertext
Markup Language: HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML).
(The only exception is when you are viewing
other “content types” like images, PDFs, movies, etc. Also, there
are a few different varieties of HTML. The most modern is HTML5.)
HTML consists of pairs of tags surrounding some content, like

```markup
<p>Mary had a little lamb</p>
```

In that example, `<p>` is the
paragraph tag and `</p>` shows where it ends.

To make web pages display that paragraph in a special font, web
developers use Cascading Style Sheets: CSS. Where as HTML tells the
browser what content is on a website, CSS tells the browser how
that content should be formatted: what color, size, position,
boldness, whatever. To make that paragraph bold, we could use a CSS
rule like `p { font-weight: bold; }`.

```javascript
var x = 5;
console.log('woot');
```

JavaScript is used to turn a web page into a web app: a web page
that is smart and has interactivity, animation, or computation. The
JavaScript you include in a web app tells the browser how the app
functions. In contrast, HTML and CSS tell the browser how the app
looks.

In this homework assignment, you will learn the basics of HTML,
CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. This is important because these
three tools allow you to build applications on the web. And, the
web is an omnipresent platform: every phone, every computer has a
web browser. Why would we learn to make iOS apps, or Blackberry
apps, or Android apps, or Windows apps? Instead, one option is that
we can make a web app and it will serve customers across all these
platforms.

HTML and CSS are easy to learn. JavaScript can be harder. You will
use the online Dash application, which was created by the Yale alums
at General Assembly, to learn HTML, CSS, and a little bit of
JavaScript. You will not be an expert after completing this assignment.
You will know enough to start working on the class project with
your team.
